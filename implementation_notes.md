**Implementation Notes**

- Metadata will be split into 3 categories:
    - Documentation
    - Analysis
    - Conservation
- We'll use the fields provided by the CH partnres and Christina as a template. Fields will include:
    - Provenance
    - Location
    - Date/period
    - type of object (excavational, archaeiological ...)
    - materials (cotton, linen ...)
    - type of weave 
    - weave count (per cm2)
    - thread diameter (in mm, um)
    - twist direction
    - twist angle
    - ply (bool) -> type of ply
    - decorations (bool) -> types of decorations -> more parameters
    - metal threads (bool) -> --//--
- Other than the pov images, allow display of other images that are assigned to the same object. Categorize them in classes based on analysis, retrieve them from the database.
- It will be one object (scene) for all users.
- Add the ability to download the object along with other related resources (metadata, source images ...).
- Investigate whether we can swap between objects based on the digitization techinque.
